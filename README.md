### This is a supplement to the manuscript # NGS-2022-03-00591 currently in review in Nature Geoscience.
 
Users need to use terminal and run "./CreateMap.sh", a bash script that creates maps of radial heat advection for Cases 1-4 at every 20 Myr since 200 Ma, places reconstructed kimberlites in circles, and dims the oceanic regions to emphasize continental blocks as we have kimberlite data only from continents.

### Please choose case number before running the code in Line 10 of CreateMap.sh as below:

``` CaseNumber=1 # Select the case number ```

The outputs for all cases are provided for reference.
